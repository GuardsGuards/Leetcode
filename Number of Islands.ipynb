    "* Goal: Get used to looping over the grid, checking 4 directions, not revisiting cells.\n",

    "## 🟨 2. **Max Area of Island (LC 695)**\n",

    "* Instead of counting islands, compute the **size** of each island and return the maximum.\n",
    "* Twist: carry an accumulator inside DFS/BFS.\n",
    "* Builds: passing state (area count) through recursion/queue.\n",

    "## 🟧 3. **Rotting Oranges (LC 994)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Grid flood-fill, but now BFS is **multi-source**.\n",
    "* You enqueue all rotten oranges (`2`s) at once and spread rot to fresh oranges (`1`s) in waves.\n",

    "* Any `'O'` connected to the **border** should survive; all others flip to `'X'`.\n",
    "* Trick: Instead of counting islands, you protect border-connected regions.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🟦 5. **Word Search (LC 79)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Grid of letters, search if a word exists.\n",
    "* Use DFS, backtracking, visited markers.\n",
    "* Twist: path-based rather than blob-based.\n",
    "* Builds: understanding when to **backtrack** (undo visited marks after recursion).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🟪 6. **Pacific Atlantic Water Flow (LC 417)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Grid of heights. Water can flow downhill. Find cells that can reach **both oceans**.\n",
    "* Twist: BFS/DFS **from the edges inward**, not from each cell outward.\n",
    "* Builds: recognizing when to flip perspective (start from the goal instead of the source).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1 → 2:** same idea, different output.\n",
    "* **2 → 3:** introduce BFS layers (time steps).\n",
    "* **3 → 4:** shift from “count” to “transform.”\n",
    "* **4 → 5:** add backtracking + path constraints.\n",
    "* **5 → 6:** add graph directionality + reverse search.\n",
