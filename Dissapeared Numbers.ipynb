    "LeetCode 448: Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array with the in-place marking trick: use each value v to index v-1 and flip that spot negative; positives at the end are the missing numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You have an array of length `n` containing integers from `1` to `n`. Some are missing, some may repeat. You want to find which ones are missing **without extra memory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Every number `v` in `1..n` has a **home index** at `v-1`.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `1` belongs at index `0`\n",
    "* `2` belongs at index `1`\n",
    "* …\n",
    "* `n` belongs at index `n-1`\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you walk through the array and, for each number `v`, mark `nums[v-1]` somehow, then at the end you know which positions were “touched” by numbers in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Marker\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers are already signed (positive/negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initially all are positive.\n",
    "* If you see a number `v`, you **flip `nums[v-1]` to negative**.\n",
    "* Negative = “this number has been seen at least once.”\n",
    "* If it’s already negative, you leave it (duplicate encountered).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any index `i` that is still positive means its number `(i+1)` was never seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Look at `4` → home index `3` → flip `nums[3]` → array becomes `[4,3,2,-7,8,2,3,1]`.\n",
    "Step 2: Look at `3` → index `2` → flip → `[4,3,-2,-7,8,2,3,1]`.\n",
    "Step 3: Look at `2` → index `1` → flip → `[4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,3,1]`.\n",
    "Step 4: Look at `7` → index `6` → flip → `[4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,1]`.\n",
    "Step 5: Look at `8` → index `7` → flip → `[4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,-1]`.\n",
    "Step 6: Look at `2` again → index `1` → already negative, skip.\n",
    "Step 7: Look at `3` again → index `2` → already negative, skip.\n",
    "Step 8: Look at `1` → index `0` → flip → `[-4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,-1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now scan:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Indices `4` and `5` are positive → numbers `5` and `6` are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output = `[5,6]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Guaranteed mapping**: Each number is between `1` and `n`, so its index `v-1` is valid.\n",
    "2. **Stable marker**: Negating preserves the number (you can still recover it with `abs`) while giving you a one-bit “seen” flag.\n",
    "3. **In-place**: No extra set/dictionary needed. Memory stays O(1).\n",
    "4. **Duplicates handled**: Multiple hits just leave the target negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **USPS DS/DE (fraud + ops data)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages are scanned at certain checkpoints (say 1–10). You expect each package to hit all checkpoints in sequence. Reality: scanners misfire or data is dropped.\n",
    " Apply the exact same trick: feed in the observed checkpoint IDs for a package, flip the seen ones, and the function returns **which checkpoints never got scanned**. That becomes your operational alert: “package 782 never hit checkpoint 5 or 7.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Most Relevant Elsewhere: Inventory / Attendance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Any situation where you expect **a fixed roster 1..N but only observe some subset**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Retail: 1–100 items should be on the shelf, scanners report 92, missing 8 are flagged.\n",
    "* Classroom: 1–30 students, attendance IDs recorded, missing IDs tell you absentees.\n",
    "* Cloud jobs: 1–500 batch IDs expected, only 485 finished logs present, missing 15 = failures.\n",
    "\n",
    " Same exact problem: expected full range, return the absent IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The core utility is: **detect gaps in a supposed complete set without using extra memory** — just flip markers in-place.\n",
