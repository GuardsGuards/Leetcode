    "# Largest Island\n",

    "## 1. **Mail Fraud / Counterfeit Clusters**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problem:** USPS runs address–to–transaction–to–package graphs. Fraud rings operate by spreading counterfeit shipments across many addresses, then recombining them.\n",
    "* **Island analog:** Given a binary grid where `1 = suspicious transaction`, the largest island = biggest fraud cell.\n",
    "* **Why it matters:** You'll know how to detect and bound “largest connected suspicious subnet.” In practice, this means clustering counterfeit detection anomalies without requiring an off-the-shelf ML model.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. **Network Outages & Routing Black Spots**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problem:** USPS has \\~30k facilities and routes. If a sorting center goes offline (weather, cyber, mechanical), you need to identify **largest contiguous region** of the network impacted.\n",
    "* **Island analog:** In a grid/graph, `0 = outage, 1 = healthy`, flip one `0` to `1` → what’s the biggest functional cluster you can restore?\n",
    "* **Why it matters:** They test if you can quickly reason about resilience, failover, and which single node/edge restoration maximizes throughput. That’s exactly “make the largest island.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Carrier Coverage Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problem:** Carriers’ routes are essentially grid graphs. If you remove one road/segment, what’s the largest reachable subgraph of households? Or, conversely, if you add one street to coverage, what’s the maximum contiguous service area gained?\n",
    "* **Island analog:** Same as LeetCode #827: flip one “0” (new street/connection) → find maximum contiguous connected component (largest service area).\n",
    "* **Why it matters:** You'll think like an ops scientist, turning route coverage into adjacency logic, and you can quantify efficiency gains with one small intervention.\n",
